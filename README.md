"# Community_Detection" 

In this project, we use several community detection methods.

In the file Traditional_methods:
    - We applied several traditional community detection methods.
    
In the file OptimalK:
    - We seek the optimal number of communities for machine learning methods.
    
In the file Unsupervised_learning:
    - We applied several unsupervised machine learning algorithms for community detection.
    
Afterwards, we compared the two approaches.
